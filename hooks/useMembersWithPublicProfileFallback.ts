/**
 * useMembersWithPublicProfileFallback
 *
 * Takes a member map (address → SpaceMember) plus a list of addresses
 * currently in view, and back-fills missing/empty entries by fetching
 * the public-profile endpoint for each address.
 *
 * Resolution rule (per user spec):
 *   - If both local member (with profileTimestamp) and public profile
 *     have timestamps: latest wins.
 *   - If only the chat-broadcast (local) has a timestamp: use chat.
 *   - If only the public profile has a timestamp: use public.
 *   - If neither has a timestamp: use public.
 *
 * Public-profile queries are React-Query-backed and shared across the
 * app via key; calling this hook from multiple surfaces won't multiply
 * the network cost. We only fire queries for addresses where the local
 * record is missing or has no display_name — fully-populated members
 * are passed through untouched, avoiding an N×fetch per chat render.
