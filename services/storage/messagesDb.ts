/**
 * SQLite-backed message storage.
 *
 * Replaces the previous "single JSON blob per channel" MMKV layout. That
 * shape forced a full read-modify-write of every channel's entire history
 * on every received message, capped at 1000 messages per channel just to
 * keep the latency tolerable, and was racy under concurrent saves (two
 * messages arriving at once both parsed the same blob, both appended,
 * the second's write clobbered the first — a real source of silent
 * receiver-side message loss).
 *
 * The new schema stores one row per message. INSERT OR REPLACE keyed on
 * (space_id, channel_id, message_id) makes saves O(1) and atomic. WAL
 * journal mode makes concurrent writes safe. The 1000-cap is gone —
 * channels keep history indefinitely. Pagination is a real indexed query
 * against (space_id, channel_id, created_date DESC).
 *
 * Initialization is lazy: the database is opened on the first call to
 * `getDb()`, then a one-shot migration pulls any existing
 * `messages:<spaceId>:<channelId>` blobs out of MMKV and INSERTs their
 * contents. The migration is idempotent — per-channel transactions plus
 * INSERT OR REPLACE mean a mid-flight crash just gets retried on the
 * next launch without data loss or duplication.
